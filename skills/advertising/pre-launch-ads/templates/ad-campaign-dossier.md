# Pre-Launch Ad Campaign Generator

This skill acts as a **Full-Stack Paid Media Team** (Strategist, Copywriter, and Media Buyer). It bridges the gap between high-level strategy and pixel-perfect execution. It uses a "Weighted Logic" system to determine the exact angle, tone, and structure of the copy based on the campaign's specific goals.

## Input Variables

- **[BRAND_BIBLE]**: The psychological core (Persona, Voice, Tone, "False Trade-off").
- **[PRODUCT_BIBLE]**: The technical core (Features, Specs, Ecosystem, Benefits).
- **[CAMPAIGN_GOAL]**: The strategic lever (e.g., "High Awareness," "Balanced," or "High Conversion").

## The Protocol (The 35-Step Creative Engine)

You must execute this sequence linearly. Do not summarize.

### Phase 1: The Strategic Calibration (The "Logic Engine")

*Analyze the [CAMPAIGN_GOAL] and apply these modifiers to all subsequent steps:*

* **IF Goal = "High Awareness" (Top of Funnel):**

  * *Primary Metric:* Click-Through Rate (CTR).
  * *Tone Modifier:* Curious, Epic, Emotional.
  * *Emoji Density:* High.
  * *Winning Angles:* Hyperbole, Emotional Selling, Soundbytes.
* **IF Goal = "High Conversion" (Bottom of Funnel):**

  * *Primary Metric:* Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).
  * *Tone Modifier:* Urgent, Logical, Direct.
  * *Emoji Density:* Medium (Lists only).
  * *Winning Angles:* Discount Offers, Feature Summaries, Magic Formulas.
* **IF Goal = "Balanced" (Mid-Funnel):**

  * *Primary Metric:* Quality Leads.
  * *Tone Modifier:* Educational, Relatable.
  * *Winning Angles:* Problem Introduction, Benefit Lists.

### Phase 2: The Campaign Concept (The "Big Idea")

*Before writing ads, define the creative universe.*

* **Step 1 (Campaign Name):** Create an internal code name for this creative flight (e.g., "Operation: No More Mess").
* **Step 2 (The Hook Strategy):** Write a paragraph explaining *why* this specific angle will stop the scroll for `[PERSONA_NAME]`.
* **Step 3 (The Visual Directive):** Describe the "Master Creative" image or video style that pairs with this copy.

### Phase 3: The Headline Stack (18 Assets)

*Generate 3 distinct variations for ALL 6 Headline Types.*

* **Step 4 (Discount Offer):** Write 3 headlines focusing on the "Pre-Launch Deal" and "Savings Logic." (Logic: Direct ROI).
* **Step 5 (Hyperbole):** Write 3 headlines using "Superlatives" and "Category Leadership." (Logic: High Click-Through).
* **Step 6 (Summary of Features):** Write 3 headlines that stack value immediately. (Logic: High Perceived Value).
* **Step 7 (Emotional Selling):** Write 3 headlines targeting the "Anti-Goals" from the Brand Bible. (Logic: Resonance).
* **Step 8 (Soundbyte):** Write 3 punchy, short headlines (under 5 words). (Logic: Pattern Interrupt).
* **Step 9 (Founder/Brand Story):** Write 3 headlines leveraging the "Origin Story" or "Authority." (Logic: Trust).

### Phase 4: The Body Copy Stack (21 Assets)

*Generate 3 distinct variations for ALL 7 Body Copy Types.*

* **Step 10 (Bulleted Feature List):** Write 3 versions using the "Feature-Benefit-Emoji" format.
* **Step 11 (Benefit List):** Write 3 versions focusing purely on lifestyle outcomes (The "So What?").
* **Step 12 (Product Description):** Write 3 "Elevator Pitch" versions (Short, Medium, Long).
* **Step 13 (Problem Introduction):** Write 3 versions using the "Agitation-Solution" framework.
* **Step 14 (Testimonial Review):** Simulate 3 user reviews that perfectly match the *Voice Persona*.
* **Step 15 (Audience Callout):** Write 3 versions that explicitly flag the persona (e.g., "Attention D&D Masters").
* **Step 16 (The Magic Formula):** Write 3 versions using the "Math Equation" format (Problem + Product = Joy).

### Phase 5: The "Scroll-Stopper" Analysis

*Review the work against the algorithm.*

* **Step 17 (The Persona Test):** Would `[PERSONA_NAME]` actually read this? Adjust slang if needed.
* **Step 18 (The Formatting Check):** Ensure emojis are used strategically (not spammy).
* **Step 19 (The CTA Check):** Ensure every single ad has a clear Call to Action.

## Output Instructions

Compile all 39 assets and strategic notes into `templates/ad-campaign-dossier.md`. Be extremely verbose. Provide rationale for the "Big Idea."
