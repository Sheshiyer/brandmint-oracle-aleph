# Community Engagement Plan

## 1. Welcome Script
**Pinned Post / Welcome Channel:**
"Welcome to the official [Brand Name] community! 👋

We’re building the ultimate [Product Category], and we need YOUR help to make it perfect.

**Start here:**
1. Introduce yourself: Where are you from?
2. What’s your biggest frustration with [Current Solutions]?
3. Check out the #sneak-peeks channel for early designs!"

## 2. Weekly Discussion Calendar

| Day | Theme | Prompt |
|-----|-------|--------|
| Mon | Motivation | "What's one goal you're trying to hit this week with [Activity]?" |
| Wed | Product Dev | "A or B? Help us choose the color for the final version!" |
| Fri | Fun/Social | "Wrong answers only: What is this [Product Component] used for?" |

## 3. Handling FUD (Crisis Management)
**Scenario:** User complains about price.
**Response:**
"Hey [Name], totally hear you. We definitely prioritized quality components like [Feature] which bumped the cost, rather than using the cheaper [Alternative] that tends to break. We want this to be the last one you ever need to buy!"
