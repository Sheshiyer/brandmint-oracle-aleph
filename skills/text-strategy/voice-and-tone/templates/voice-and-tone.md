# Voice Prompt Template

Please craft marketing copy that uses a {{TONE_1}}, {{TONE_2}}, and {{TONE_3}} tone, echoing the voice of a fellow {{VOICE_PERSONA}}. This voice should reflect a deep understanding of the {{CULTURE}} culture, use {{LINGO}} language, and convey genuine excitement about {{INTEREST}}. It should also display empathy towards the unique challenges {{VOICE_PERSONA}} face, offering solutions that resonate with their specific needs and aspirations. The copy should engage emotionally, acknowledging the sense of {{EMOTION_1}}, {{EMOTION_2}}, {{EMOTION_3}}, and {{EMOTION_4}} a dedicated {{VOICE_PERSONA}} seeks. Remember to make it sound like a conversation between friends, highlighting that our brand shares their interests, understands their struggles, and is committed to enhancing their {{INTEREST}} experience.
