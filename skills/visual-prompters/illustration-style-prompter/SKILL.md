# Illustration Style Prompter

Generate production-ready AI image prompts for non-photorealistic art across 6 distinct style families. Templates range from Notion-style vector icons to ukiyo-e woodblock prints, all with variable substitution for instant customization.

## When to Use

- Creating poster designs (grid, sport, collage, movie, tribute, holiday)
- Generating Notion-style character icons or halftoned avatars
- Designing branded sticker packs or minimalist monogram icons
- Creating anime-inspired character illustrations with personality traits
- Generating woodblock print / ukiyo-e style art
- Designing Swiss Design typographic posters
- Creating retro American lettering or embossed logo treatments

## Workflow

1. **Accept inputs:** Subject or brand + output type (poster / icon / sticker / anime / woodblock / typography)
2. **Route to template family** in `references/prompt-templates.md`
3. **Inject variables:** [BRAND NAME], [CHARACTER NAME], [TRAIT], [SUBJECT], [COLOR], etc.
4. **Output** complete prompt for image generation

## Template Families

| Family | Templates | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Posters | 4.7, 4.9, 4.1-4.6, 4.8 | Campaign grids, holiday themes, photo collages, movie posters |
| Icons | 5.1, 5.2, 5.4 | Notion avatars, minimalist character monograms |
| Stickers | 5.3 | Branded sticker sheet sets (8-10 pieces) |
| Typography Art | 8.2, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6 | Retro lettering, embossed logos, Swiss Design posters, heritage rebranding |
| Anime | Aleena Amir template | Personality-driven character design |
| Woodblock | Alexandra Aisling template | Ukiyo-e prints with wood grain texture |

## Key Design Principles

- Vector art: thick monoline outlines, selective black fills, no gradients
- Sticker sheets: die-cut borders, knolling layout, high-contrast background
- Woodblock: bold carved lines, flat color planes, visible wood grain, ink bleed
- Anime: personality-first design ([TRAIT] drives clothing, pose, expression)
- Typography: style-specific (retro baseball script vs copperplate engraving vs Swiss sans-serif)
