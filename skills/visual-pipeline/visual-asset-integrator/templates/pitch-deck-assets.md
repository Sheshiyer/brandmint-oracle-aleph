# Pitch Deck Asset Integration Template

> **TODO:** This template depends on `pitchdeck-skill` which is deferred to Phase 4.
> Once `pitchdeck-skill` is migrated into `brandmint/skills/`, this template should define
> the asset placement rules for pitch deck slides.

## Planned Sections

- Hero slide background image placement
- Product shot integration into feature slides
- Team/founder headshot positioning
- Chart/graph brand-styled overlays
- Logo placement and sizing rules
- Color overlay and glass effect specifications
